Thank you for obtaining World Space Trees - FUll version

This pack will have regular updates with new trees being made monthly.
Currently added: Pine effect trees
ToDo: Blossom / Cherry
	  Oak
	  Sycamore
	  Chesnut
				
In this pack a new shader variation has been created for a dither effect instead of cutout, both options are available.


This system allows for variation based on placement via the shader.
With world space enable it will switch the texture quadrant of the leafs to an
adjacent one based on its position fraction.

You can toggle this feature in the materials.

New features (March 5th, 2019)

Better translucency control
Sun Down control (makes the colors darker based on the light position, great for day/night cycles)

Refined parameters.

Switched out the old shaders as they were created with Shader Forge and some features were not being supported.

When making your own textures, move them to each quadrant with the normal and translucency maps lined up.

Several versions and a demo video have been made, link on the Asset store page for this product.

Note:

Mesh imports scale need to be set to 0.01 and not use file scale to work correctly with terrain. You can also chage the 0.01 to something else if
you want to affect the 'base scale' of the tree meshes. This has been set up for you in this pack.

Defects:

Post processing effects such as AO or Depth Of Field may have problems due to the nature of zbuffering or depth sorting (hardware)
